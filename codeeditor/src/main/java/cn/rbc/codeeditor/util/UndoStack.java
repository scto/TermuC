/**
 * Implements undo/redo for insertion and deletion events of TextBuffer
 * 
 * This class is tightly coupled to the implementation of TextBuffer, in 
 * particular the inner workings of the gap data structure to optimize 
 * undo/redo efficiency
 * 
 * When text is inserted/deleted...
 * 1. Before text is inserted/deleted, TextBuffer calls captureInsert()/captureDelete()
 * 2. If the insertion/deletion is a continuation of the previous edit,
 *    the incoming edit is merged with the top entry of the undo stack.
 *    For 2 edits to be considered continuous, they must be the same type,
 *    (insert or delete), occur within a pre-defined time interval of MERGE_TIME,
 *    and the later edit must start off where the caret would have been after
 *    the earlier edit.
 * 3. If the incoming edit is not continuous with the previous one, a new entry
 *    for it is pushed on the stack
 * 
 * Batch mode:
 * A client application can specify consecutive insert/delete operations to
 * undo/redo as a group. Edits made between a call to beginBatchEdit()
 * and a closing endBatchEdit() call are grouped as a unit.
 * 
 * Undo/redo:
 * Undo/redo commands merely move the stack pointer and do not delete or insert 
 * entries. Only when a new edit is made will the entries after the stack
 * pointer be deleted.
 * 
 * Optimizaton notes:
 * Edited characters are copied lazily. When a new entry is pushed on the undo
 * stack, only the starting position and length of the inserted/deleted segment
 * is recorded. When another entry is pushed or when the entry is first undone,
 * the affected characters are then copied over. This optimization exploits the
 * non-destructive nature of continuous edits in TextBuffer -- deleted characters
 * can be retrieved from the gap and inserted characters are trivially available.
 * For undo/redo of the topmost entry, only the gap boundaries of TextBuffer
 * need to be moved.
